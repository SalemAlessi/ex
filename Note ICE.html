            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> The method of increasing the air capacity or density of an engine in known as supercharging.</li>
                <li>supercharger is merely a blower or a compressor that provides a denser charge to the engine. </li>

            </ol>
        </div>

      <div>
            <h3>objectives</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>for ground installations it is used to produce a gain in the power output of the engine</li>
                <li>for aircraft installations , in addition to produce a gain in the power output at sea level , it also enables the engine to maintain a higher power output as altitude is increased</li>
            </ol>
      </div>
      
      <div>
            <h3>SI engines </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> supercharging in SI engine is employed only in aircraft and racing car engines.</li>
                <li>Apart from increasing the volumetric effciency of the engine , supercharging results in an increase in the intake temperature of the engine.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
                  
            <h3>CI engine</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>in case of CI engines , supercharging dose not result in any combustion problem , rather it improves combustion.</li>
                <li>Increase Of Pressure And temperature of the induced air reduces ignition delay, and hence the rate of pressure rise results in a better, quieter and smoother combustion</li> 
            </ol>

                <li>the fuel injection system most occur at the correct moment.</li>
                <li>it should supply the fule in correct quantity as required bt the varying engine loads.</li>
                <li>the injected fuel must be broken into very fine droplets.</li>
                <li> the spray pattern should ensure rapid mixing of fuel and air. </li>
                <li>it should supply equal quantites of metered fuel to all the cylinders in a mulit cylinder engines.</li>
                <li>the beginning and the end of injection should be sharp. </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>element of fule injection system</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li> pumping element : to supply fuel from fuel tank to cylinder . </li>
                <li> metering element : to meter fule supply as per load and Speed . </li>
                <li>distribution element : to divide the metered fuel equaally among the cylinder </li>
                <li>timing control : to adjust the start and stop of injection.</li>
                <li>mixing element : to atomize and distrbute the fuel within the combustion chamber.</li>

            <h3>Lubrication system</h3>
            <ol>
                <h4>Purpose Of Lubrication</h4>
                <li> to teduce the frictional resistance of the engine to a minimum to ensure maxmimum mechanical effciency.</li>
                <li>protect the engine against wear.</li>
                <li>serve as a cooling agent by picking uo heat.</li>
                <li>remove all impurities from the lubricated region.</li>
                <li>form a seal between piston rings and the cylinder walls to prevent blower.</li>

<div class="Fuel">
    <div>
        <h4>Conventional fuels</h4> 
        <p> fossil fuels (petroleum) , coal , and nuclear materials such as uranium</p>

        <h4>Alternative fuels.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> also known as non-conventional fuels.</li>
            <li>any materials or substances that can be used as fuels , other than Conventional fuels.</li>
            <li>which is consumed to provide energy to power an engine . <br></li>
        
        </ol>
    
        <h4> Ethanol </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>mainly produced by the sugar fermentation process</li>
            <li>can also be manufactured by the chemical process of reacting Ethanol with steam.</li>
            <li>A clear colorless liquid , its biodegradable , low in toxicity and causes little environmental pollution if spilt.</li>
            <li>Ethanol is a high octane fuel and has replaced lead as an octance enhancer in petrol.</li>
            <li>widely sold in the USA.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4> Biodiesel </h4>
        <ol> 
            <li>Biodiesel contains no petroleum, but it can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel.</li>
            <li>it can be used in compression-ignition (diesel) engine with little or no modifications.</li>
            <li>Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel manufactured from :  vegetable oils , animal fats , recycled restaurant greases.</li>

        </ol>
        <h4>Hydrogen</h4>

            <li>A potenially emissions-free alternative fuel produced from domestic resources.</li>
            <li>not widely used today as a transportation fuel.</li>
            <li>not occur free in nature in usful quantities , but it is manufactured.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Compressed Natural Gas</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> a fossil fuel substitute for gasoline (petrol) , diesel fuel and propane LPG.</li>
            <li>a more Environmentally alternative to Conventional fuels.</li>
            <li>  it is much safer than fuels in the event of a spill , because natural gas is lighter than air and disperses quickly when relesed.</li>
            <li>made by compressing natural gas (wich is mainly composed of methane , CH4 ) to less than 1 percent of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure .</li>
